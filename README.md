# ICS-QUADRATIC-GRADER-HAMWENDA-MUKANDO-
This is a simple web application designed to solve quadratic functions of the form ax^2+bx+c=0. this web application provides a user-friendly interface to input the coefficients and calculates the root based on the discriminant.
**HOW IT RUNS**
*input coefficients a, b, and c.
*compute roots.
Display Results.
**TESTING CASES**
Invalid Input: Tset with valid numbers for a, b, and c to ensure acurate calculation of roots and the roots themselves.
Edge cases: Test with a-0 to ensure web application correctly id's and handles non-quadratic equations.
Complex Roots: To verify complex roots
